# Dog Shop Koda

**Completion Date:** September 2022

## Introduction
Owning a dog is an exciting and fulfilling experience, but it also comes with great responsibility. One of the first questions people ask when considering getting a dog is, "Which breed is right for me?" Factors like space (yard vs. home), size, energy levels, and other lifestyle considerations all play a role in this decision. However, even after selecting a breed, finding a suitable breeder or shelter can be time-consuming.

**Dog Shop Koda** aims to make the entire process easier by bringing everything to one place. This web application assists users in choosing a breed that fits their lifestyle, provides descriptions and images of various breeds, and connects potential dog owners with breeders or shelters.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a web shop application focused on showcasing dogs available for sale or adoption. Unlike traditional online stores, Dog Shop Koda does not handle direct purchases or payments; instead, it presents detailed information about each dog breed and the breeders or shelters that care for them. Buyers and sellers communicate directly to arrange the terms of sale or adoption.

This application is designed for multiple types of users:
- **Administrator**: Responsible for system maintenance and management.
  - Ability to block sellers and delete inappropriate content.
  - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing sellers and dog listings.
- **Seller**: Individuals or organizations selling or giving away dogs.
  - Can add dog profiles with breed descriptions, prices, photos, and more.
  - Registration and login functionality.
  - Ability to enter and update their own and their dogs' information.
- **Buyer**: Users looking to buy or adopt dogs.
  - A home page featuring randomly selected dogs available for sale or adoption.
  - Search functionality (by breed, location, breeder name, etc.).
  - A “For the Undecided” section, where buyers can answer questions or input specific requirements to receive breed recommendations suited to their needs.
